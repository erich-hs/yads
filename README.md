# yads - YAML-Augmented Data Specification

`yads` is a Python library for managing data specifications using YAML. It helps you define and manage your data warehouse tables, schemas, and documentation in a structured, version-controlled way. With `yads`, you can define your data assets once in YAML and then generate various outputs like DDL statements for different databases, data schemas for tools like Avro or PyArrow, and human-readable, LLM-ready documentation.

## Why yads?

The modern data stack is complex, with data assets defined across a multitude of platforms and tools. This often leads to fragmented and inconsistent documentation, making data discovery and governance a challenge. `yads` was created to address this by providing a centralized, version-controllable, and extensible way to manage metadata for modern data platforms.

The main goal of `yads` is to provide a single source of truth for your data assets using simple YAML files. These files can capture everything from table schemas and column descriptions to governance policies and usage notes. From these specifications, `yads` can transpile the information into various formats, such as DDL statements for different SQL dialects, Avro or PyArrow schemas, and generate documentation that is ready for both humans and Large Language Models (LLMs).
